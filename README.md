# Disaster Response Pipeline Project
Analyzing disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
<<<<<<< HEAD
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier, shows how it works(prints, accuracy, precission ... scores) and saves the model
=======
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
